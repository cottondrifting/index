            <p> Like I said before, I'm a 20 year old struggling student, doing my best, keeping my cool,
                still being a nerd watching anime and playing my visual novels and whatnot. I'm getting more
                into art than I was before (I gave up for a bit), I even bought a drawing tablet. I barely had time
                to use it though, but maybe I will now with my short winter break.

                Taking a web design class has a ride. When I first started, I barely ahd any idea what I was doing, I
                hardly remembered anything I thought I learned before. I barely even knew the difference between HTML
                and
                CSS, like, HTML is the structure, and CSS is the style, right? But luckily it didn't take long for me to
                figure it out. I got the hang of most things pretty quickly I think, well at least in the beginning.
                Really,
                my main struggle was understanding what certain things were meant for, like using sticky vs fixed vs
                absolute
                and things like that. Some things are easy though, like the favicon part, which was mostly copying and
                pasting.
                Weirdly that was my favorite part (lol), I remember when I saw the favicon on my iphone thinking it was
                really cool.
                Seeing the bigger picture it all eventually started to make sense. I got familiar with VSCode and its
                plugins
                and shortcuts which have been helpful, especially for catching little mistakes and formatting things
                neatly.
                I also learned a lot about basic CSS styles, like how to change fonts, colors, and align things properly
                on
                the page. Figuring out layouts was one of the harder parts, especially when it came to positioning
                things like
                images and using floats, margins, and padding. To keep everything straight, I started taking notes on
                the structure
                of a page and the elements and stuff, thank goodness I did because it really helped me stay organized
                and memorize
                how everything fits together, rules and things of that sort.

                Now that I’m more familiar with HTML and CSS, I might consider learning more and turning website-making
                into a side
                hustle. I’m not sure I’d want to make it my whole career, though, it’s fun, but it’s definitely a lot of
                work, and it
                did burn me out at times. But honestly it did inspire me to explore other computer related work. :]
