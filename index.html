<h1>Hello class... </h1>
<h2>A bit about me. </h2>
<p>I'm 20 years old. I like anime, jrpgs, and visual novels. I'm taking this class mostly
    because I'm undecided on what I want my career to be, so maybe if I enjoy this kinda
    stuff I can learn more in the future, enough for a career. Basically I'm just trying stuff out.
    Hopefully webdev stuff isn't too difficult because it does seem like something I
    wouldn't mind as a job.
