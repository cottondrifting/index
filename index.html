				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p> I’m a pretty average 20-year-old college student, working but doing what I can when I can. I’m into art,
				anime, and music, the usual stuff, and like college I try to make time for these as much as possible,
				they’re honestly what’s keeping me sane right now. Art is something I’ve been into for as long as I can
				remember, it’s a nice escape from whatever is bugging me. Anime is kind of the same, I’ve been into it
				forever and it’s several mediums make me never get tired of it. Music is more of a recent passion for me
				but is also a huge part of my life now. I make most of my friends now through music related stuff.

				I’m not new to code, I always had an interest for computer things, and in middle school I had a class
				where I just went on Scratch for the whole hour, and I’d make little games and animations. And a couple
				years ago I was also trying to learn HTML so I could make a Neocities website, though I gave up on that
				pretty quickly. Good thing I’m learning it for real this time, right? Now that I’m older and know all
				the things code is used for, I am especially interested, specifically for making visual novels. The idea
				of combining art, story, and a bit of coding to create interactive stories just sounds so fun. </p>

				<h2>My Avatar</h2>
			</header>
			<p class="pcolor"> I wasn’t sure what avatar you meant but I assume you mean our GitHub avatars? Well
				anyway, mine is Nyami
				from Pop’n Music. I didn’t pick her for any specific reason, she is just a cute cat girl thing and she
				was in my gallery. I’m not even a big Pop’n Music fan if I’m being honest. All the Pop’n characters are
				cute though, but I do like Nyami and Mimi the most because they kind of remind me of Lammy from Um
				Jammer Lammy, even their outfits are pretty similar, with their whole 2000s baggy look. And they’re both
				from sorta niche rhythm games which is cool. </p>

		<section id="learning">
			<header>
				<h2>My Learning Journey So Far</h2>
			</header>
			<p> For this project of course I’m learning HTML, which has been interesting so far. I’ve only been at it
				for a couple weeks since the class did pretty much just started, so I haven’t made a ton of progress
				yet. I managed to set up a simple webpage, though, which was satisfying to see. Seeing something
				actually show up from what I typed felt like an accomplishment, even if it’s just text on a page. It’s
				cool to see how HTML kind of builds the structure of websites.

				I was sick recently, so I’m pretty behind in class, but I’m trying to catch up. HTML looks like a good
				starting point for understanding web development and code stuff, and I’m curious to see where it could
				lead. I’d like to eventually learn to code for games and visual novels or other creative projects if I
				can keep up with it, but for now, it’s just about getting the basics down. It’s nice to feel like I’m
				slowly working towards something I might actually use. </p>
